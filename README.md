# 2021_Bahkar

This code runs on FRC4188's Bakhar playing the 2021 replay of Infinte Recharge.

The program is written in the Command Based Framework.

There is a utils folder in the package "frc.robot" which holds programs to run
seperately from commands and subsystems, such as TempManager, or classes to assist
subsystems, such as WheelDrive.

The Constants class ONLY holds constants.
