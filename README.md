# 2021_Bahkar
This code runs on FRC4188's Bakhar playing the 2021 replay of Infinte Recharge.

The program is written in the Command Based Framework. 

The Constants class ONLY holds constants. These values may only be used in one
place but they are all held in the Constants class for a centralized "tuning file"
so that changes to the robot can be easily accounted for in code.

This project uses the *Spotless* code formatter. To run the formatter, run
"./gradlew spotlessApply" in the VSCode terminal.
